# simple-angucomplete-alt
The purpose of this package is to simplify the use of angucomplete-alt. It's easy to turn the [angucomplete-alt](https://github.com/ghiden/angucomplete-alt) into something more like a select-ajax.

When you connect ngModel to the selectedObject of the angucomplete, this package helps in migrating large select fields to the angucomplete without worrying about writing long AngularJS settings and functions.

# Install vie bower
```bower install simple-angucomplete-alt```
